cabal-version:      2.4
-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- Initial package description generated by 'cabal init'. For further
-- documentation, see: http://haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/

-- The name of the package.

-- FIXME: It's still unclear to me what would be the best strategy to let users
-- publish packages generated by `cabal-pack` on Hackage. While it is pretty
-- hazardous to put Rust code in sdist archive (because that would require that
-- the library end-user have a Rust developer environment on this machine and
-- that wouldn't play well with cross-compilation), is it a good idea to
-- package generated platform-dependent library as source?
